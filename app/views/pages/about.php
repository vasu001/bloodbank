                        We are the online blood banking company which ensures that
                        donated blood, or blood products, are safe before they are used in blood
                        transfusions and other medical procedures. Blood banking includes typing the blood for
                        transfusion and testing for infectious
                        diseases.The term "blood bank" typically refers to a division of a hospital where the storage of
                        blood product occurs and where proper testing is performed (to reduce the risk of transfusion
                        related adverse events). However, it sometimes refers to a collection center, and indeed some
                        hospitals also perform collection.
